Overview
Aurora Solar is excited to announce a new financing integration with GoodLeap. You can now configure your GoodLeap account and connect it directly with your Aurora account within Sales Mode.

Conduct a soft credit check on behalf of the homeowner and apply for a loan from Aurora’s Sales Mode quickly; 
Show the homeowner GoodLeap loan products in approved language;
Say goodbye to manual data entry into the GoodLeap Portal, and the need to manually manage your GoodLeap products in Aurora.

 
Process Overview


Step 1: You can submit a credit application within Aurora’s Sales Mode for your homeowner. Note, this will result in a soft credit pull only. 


Step 2: When the homeowner is approved for credit, the loan documents will be sent via email to the homeowner.  


Step 3: When the homeowner navigates to their email, they will see a link and click to navigate to the loan documents, and are able to apply for a loan within GoodLeap.
