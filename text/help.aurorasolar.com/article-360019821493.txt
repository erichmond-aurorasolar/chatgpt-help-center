Video: How to Use the Street View Ruler Tool


The Street View Ruler tool can be used to get 3D measurements of trees, building heights, obstructions, and roof pitches that are visible in Street View . These measurements can help refine 3D measurements from LIDAR or provide accurate measurements where LIDAR is not available.
You can use the tool to measure pitch, height, or distance.
