Jurisdictions

Aurora allows you to predefine jurisdictional requirements, such as roof setbacks. Whenever you create a new design, Aurora will look up the relevant jurisdictional information and associate it with your design. 
To create a new Jurisdiction:
1. Go to your Database in the top menu of your Aurora page.

2. In the left hand side bar, click on Jurisdictions. 
3. Click on Add Jurisdiction. You can either create a state-wide Jurisdiction (select State from the Type dropdown) or tie the Jurisdiction to a location (address). 

On the next screen you can specify the following settings:


Name: The name of the jurisdiction

Type: The type of the jurisdiction (either State or Local)

State: The state this jurisdiction applies to (only available if Type is State)

Address: The address (location) of the jurisdiction (only available if Type is Local)

Setbacks: The setbacks requirements for this jurisdiction

Building Notes: A free form text field for any information that may be relevant during the roof modeling process. Aurora will make this information available to designers in Site Model → 2D.

Design Notes: A free form text field for any information that may be relevant during the roof modeling process. Aurora will make this information available to designers in Design → System Design.
