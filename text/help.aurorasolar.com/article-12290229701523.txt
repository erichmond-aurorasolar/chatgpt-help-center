Creating a Project in New Aurora

In Aurora, a project is defined as a unique address.  Within each project, you can create multiple different designs.  Follow the steps below to create a new project within Aurora. 

 
Start by clicking on the "+ New project" button in the top right corner of the Project Index page.

Type in the project address, and verify that the pin on the satellite view is on top of the correct building. You can also give the project a unique name if you'd like.
Make sure that your project is set to Residential since Commercial projects are not supported in Sales Mode.
Now click "Create".

 
As soon as you've created a new project, you'll be brought to the Project Dashboard.Here you can see and edit the customer's contact information, energy usage, and view all designs for this given project address.

 
You can also use the left hand navigation menu to jump into these same sections.
