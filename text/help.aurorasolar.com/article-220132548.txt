Overview

Shading can have a significant impact on the performance of PV systems so shading analysis is an essential step in solar design. Shading on a roof can come from a variety of factors, including trees, roof obstructions, neighboring buildings and self-shading from other roof faces.
Aurora gives you a number of tools to assess the solar potential of a site and to determine the impact of shading on system energy production.


Irradiance Maps allow you to visualize the solar potential of a site and to get shade measurements remotely.


The Shade Simulator lets you visualize shade cast by objects on the site.
