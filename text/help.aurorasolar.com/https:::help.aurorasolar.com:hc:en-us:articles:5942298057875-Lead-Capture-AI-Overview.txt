Lead Capture AI Overview

 
Lead Capture AI empowers marketers at solar businesses to boost their website conversion rates and generate higher-quality leads with an innovative lead capture experience for homeowners, powered by Aurora’s industry-leading solar design software.

With Lead Capture AI, you can supercharge your web experience with an embeddable, interactive widget. When this widget is embedded into a website, homeowners can input their address and average monthly utility bill to receive an accurate quote in about a minute. 
Once this information is submitted, Aurora’s proprietary AI model uses HD satellite imagery and LIDAR to create a 3D estimate of their home, design a system to offset a certain percentage of their bill, and show them their estimated bill savings. Homeowners can toggle around the 3D estimate, and request a quote from the solar company.
When homeowners submit their information, they become a Lead in the Aurora database. You can deliver this lead and their qualification information to other technologies in your stack via a Zapier integration, or you can view and convert the lead into an Aurora project directly in the Aurora application.
