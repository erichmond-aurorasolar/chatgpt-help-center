How to Use the Streetview Ruler Tool 


The Streetview Ruler tool can be used to get 3D measurements of trees, building heights, obstructions, and roof pitches that are visible in Streetview. These measurements can help refine 3D measurements from LIDAR or provide accurate measurements where LIDAR is not available You can use the tool to measure pitch, height, or distance.
 
Using the Streetview Ruler tool to measure pitch:

Click on the Street View ruler icon in the bottom left-hand corner of your design window.

Place 3 nodes in design view. Ensure you choose places that are visible in street view.

The tool will automatically move you to the next step once you place the third node.
If you make a mistake and want to edit the nodes in Design view, click "Back".

In Streetview, move the nodes to exactly mirror the corresponding nodes in Design view.

When you're happy with the node placement, click "Done" to calculate.  The ruler measurement tool will be placed in your design window.

 
Using the Streetview Ruler tool to measure height:

Click on the Street View ruler icon in the bottom left-hand corner of your design window.
To measure the height of an object, such as a tree or obstruction, place 2 nodes on top of each other in design view.

Once the nodes are accurately placed, click "Next" to move to next step.
In street view, place the corresponding nodes at the top and bottom of the object you want to measure.

When you're happy with the node placement, click "Done" to calculate.  The ruler measurement tool will be placed in your design window.

 
Using the Streetview Ruler tool to measure distance: 

Click on the Street View ruler icon in the bottom left-hand corner of your design window.
To measure the distance from one point to another, place 2 nodes in design view at each end of the distance you want to measure.

Once the nodes are accurately placed, click "Next" to move to next step.
In street view, place the corresponding nodes at the top and bottom of the object you want to measure.

When you're happy with the node placement, click "Done" to calculate.  The ruler measurement tool will be placed in your design window.
