Lead Index and Lead Overview

The Lead Index within the Aurora application contains all of the submitted leads from your Lead Capture AI instance. As soon as a lead provides their information in Lead Capture AI, you’ll have immediate access to their contact and qualification information, enabling you to act quickly on any warm inbound lead.
Note: You can also integrate your lead information from Lead Capture AI to most CRMs, email, Google Sheets, and other cloud apps via Zapier. To learn more about how to deliver your leads to other technologies, navigate to our Lead Capture AI technical docs here.
