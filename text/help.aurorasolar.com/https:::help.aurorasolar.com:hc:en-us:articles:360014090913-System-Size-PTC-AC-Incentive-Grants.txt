System Size PTC / AC Incentive Grants

 
 
 
This incentive accounts for system size grants that are based on PTC , AC and STC. 
PTC (Performance Test Conditions) will be slightly less than STC. Solar PTC refers to what panels produce under performance test conditions. The AC System Size will be based on the total inverter power output of the design. 
 
STC, or Standard Test Conditions, is also known as “Nameplate Rating.” This is calculated as the wattage is multiplied by the number of panels.
