Financing Products in New Aurora - Account Configuration

Within New Aurora, you can create custom financing products to model, or you can integrate your Mosaic account directly within Aurora.  
Please note that only account Administrators can make these changes. 
 
Modeling Custom Financing Products
Within your Database, you can configure custom financing products to model within your projects.  You can enable the loans, leases, or PPAs that you create in your database and they will then be available to choose from in the Financing page of Sales Mode.  Please note that if you don't set anything up here, Cash will be the only financing option for your projects.
