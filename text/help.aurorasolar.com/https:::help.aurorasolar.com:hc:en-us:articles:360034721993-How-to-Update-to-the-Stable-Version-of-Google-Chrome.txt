How to Update to the Stable Version of Google Chrome

A recent version of Google Chrome caused Aurora to crash frequently. Some users were directed to try Chrome Beta as a workaround. As of July 30, 2019 Google has updated their Stable version of Chrome, resolving this stability issue. While your choice of browser is a personal choice, we no longer suggest using Chrome Beta and encourage our users to move back to the Stable version for the best experience.
What is Chrome Beta?
Chrome Beta is one step ahead of the stable version, so it gets new features and enhancements first, however since it is a beta software (it is being tested), you may find weird behavior or crashes, etc.
