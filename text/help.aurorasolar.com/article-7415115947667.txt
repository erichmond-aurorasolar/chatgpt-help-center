Add pages to the Web Proposal

Within Aurora settings, admins can add custom page types to their Sales Mode presentation. To add these to your Web Proposal presentation as well, navigate to any custom page in Sales Mode settings, click Edit, then make sure the “Include in web proposal” toggle is turned on.

As an admin user, navigate to Sales Mode Customization settings
Select any custom page and click Edit

Add a Page Title, Heading, and Message

Choose to display an image or a video. Note that videos must be hosted on Youtube or Vimeo

Click Add Page to finish, and the page will format automatically upon completion

 

Please note:


Custom pages will be added to the web proposal in the same order as they are displayed in the Sales Mode presentation.

Custom pages cannot be created only for the web proposal, they must also appear in the Sales Mode presentation.
You can preview the web proposal under Settings > Sales Mode customization > Preview proposal
