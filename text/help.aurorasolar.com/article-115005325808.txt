How do I input SRECs into my Financial Analysis?

In Aurora, SRECs can be incorporated into your financial analysis as a Performance Based Incentive (PBI).

As you create your financing option, click on Add Incentive. 


Click on Choose an incentive then Create Custom Incentive.


Toggle to the Performance tab and set the scope as Local. You can then plug in the rate and escalation. 
The rate of the incentive per kWh will be equal to (.001 x price of SREC).  For example, if I am in a state where 1 SREC is $260, I would calculate my rate as (260 x .001 = .26)

In the example above, the incentive covers an SREC of $260. The scope is set to the local level, the rate is 0.26, the duration is 5 years, and it is not taxable.

SRECs can also be shown in the Cashflow Table (proposal template). Click the cashflow table, then click the View settings, then check PBI (Performance-based incentives).
