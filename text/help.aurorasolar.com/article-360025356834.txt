Google HD and 3D imagery

Aurora is proud to announce our new partnership with Google, granting unprecedented HD imagery access to all our customers and an expanded map of 3D imagery to our Premium customers!
 
HD Imagery by Google
Now all Aurora customers will have access to a new high-definition source of satellite imagery for designs--Google's HD imagery.  Where available, the new HD images will display by default, allowing you to design with unprecedented accuracy.
