Which browser is Aurora compatible with?

For the best experience with Aurora, we recommend using the most recently updated version of Google Chrome on a desktop computer or laptop. As of right now, we do not recommend using an iPad or tablet.

Open up Google Chrome.
Click on the vertical 3 dotted icon in the top right corner.

Click on Settings in the drop down menu. This will direct you to a new tab.

In the left hand toolbar of the new tab, click on About.


The update will start automatically. If it does not start automatically, click on Update Chrome.
