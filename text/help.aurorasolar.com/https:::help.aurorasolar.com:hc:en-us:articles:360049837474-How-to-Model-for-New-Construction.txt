How to Model for New Construction

Aurora allows you to model from construction plans or blueprints which is very useful when designing for a building that is not yet built.
Upload Your Plans
Before you upload the construction plan file, please make sure that it is in either of these formats:  .jpeg, .jpg, or .png 
The system does not accept multiple page files, including .pdf files. 
Take a screenshot of the roof building plans if the file is not in an accepted format. On a mac, you can take a screenshot of your screen by hold these three keys together: Shift, Command, and 3. On a pc, you can take a screenshot of your screen using the Snipping Tool.
After verifying the file format of your plans, follow the steps on this article to upload your image: How to Upload Custom Imagery (Including how to Upload Drone Imagery) 
Scaling your plans
To scale your image you can use the Ruler Tool. Using the measurement of a wall on your plans as a reference along with the ruler tool, you can scale the plans to the correct size. 
Once you have the plans scaled, you are ready to begin modeling!
