How to create carport and ground mount templates (administrators only)

Available for Premium Memberships only

 
To create a template 


For administrators, once you have a ground mount or carport placed within a design of a project, select all the components that you would like pre-set to place for future designs. To learn how to add, check out this link here: How to Design a Ground Mount System

Click on Save as template in the bottom right corner.
Enter in a name up to your discretion, then go back to insert panels. Select Carport/ Ground mount then click on Pre-configure.
Select the template you have set, then click Draw.
Click on one end where you'd like the array to start, then extend where you would like this to go.
Within the box you specify, there are red boxes that outline where your pre-set arrays will go. 


Editing templates in a Design


Like all other design elements you can drag, resize, rotate, and copy-paste templates.
Templates also snap to rulers so you can accurately space them out on a parking lot.
You can also use the inspector to “Explode” the template and change properties.

For performance reasons the components inside the template only update at the end of a drag or copy-paste.
