Fixed issue where having too many setbacks can slow down the application.
Added full text search for proposal templates.
Tuned zoom button speeds.
Removed current safety factor of 1.25. We used a factor of 1.25 * the input current into an inverter for NEM validation and inverter string sizing rules. This is no longer industry best practice and has been removed.
Improved automatic assignment of strings to inverter MPPTs, and improved inverter input port constraints.
