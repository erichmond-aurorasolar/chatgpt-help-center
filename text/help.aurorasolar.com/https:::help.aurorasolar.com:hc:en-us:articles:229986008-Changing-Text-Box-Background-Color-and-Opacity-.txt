Changing Text Box Background Color and Opacity 

        
A popular design effect is to overlay text on a beautiful image, such as a 3D model of the house, or an inspirational image. When you do that, it is a often a good idea to have a slightly opaque text box so that you can distinguish the text from the image. 

After creating your textbox right click to access its settings.
Click on the blank box next to the Background Color option.
Use the color scale to choose your color, or enter the appropriate hexadecimal code. 
Use the slider, or input a percentage to set the background opacity.
