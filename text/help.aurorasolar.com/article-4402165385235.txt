Submitting a Request to our Expert Design Service

Aurora’s 3D Modeling Service provides users with an opportunity to request a 3D model within the app. We have teamed up with a group of professionals to provide you with fast, accurate models of your work sites!* Each model includes Nearmap HD imagery. 
To request a model, follow these steps:
Step 1: Create New Project and enter your desired address
Go to the Project List → Click "+ Project" to start a new project → enter the address for your target location.
Step 2: Click "Get Started" and begin a new design
From the Project Dashboard, click the 'Get Started' button to begin your first design

Step 3: Click "Send Request"

Step 4: Ensure that your project marker is over your target property and submit your request

Step 5: Relax while you wait for your 3D model! 
Your model should be returned within 3 hours. You can check the progress of your request by looking at the time wheel next to the Model Request either within the project or on the Projects tab.
 
Once the model is finished, you will receive an email from Aurora Solar informing you of the completion of your request with a link to review the design. If you are pleased with the design, click ‘Use This Model’ to design your system!
If you are unhappy with the model, you can choose to have the model adjusted by our team or cancel your request and we'll refund your credit:
