Launching Sales Mode
To launch Sales Mode simply click on 'Sales Mode' from within the Project Dashboard and select an existing design or you can create a new one.

 
Enter Customer Contact Info & Energy Usage
Enter your customer’s contact information and energy usage.  If you’ve already entered this information on the Project Dashboard it will be auto populated on these initial pages of Sales Mode.

 
Create a Site Model
Within Sales Mode, you'll want to create your site model either using Aurora AI* or with a design that has already been created manually, (either by our Expert Design Services team or one that you've drawn yourself using our Smart Roof tool in Design Mode).  
*Note: Aurora AI and Expert Design requests are add on products/services 

 
Adding Solar Modules & Assessing Shading Threats
Once you’ve created your 3D site model you'll place panels on the design and can use our shading analysis tools to determine any shading threats and optimal panel placement for that design.



Built In Shading Analysis Tools:

LIDAR
Sun path

Irradiance


 
Please note that if you need to make any further adjustments to the site or system, you can always do so in Design Mode.
 
The Storage Overview Page 
Select a battery storage option for your system on the next page and show the homeowner the backup potential of the system.

 
Environmental Impact Page
The Environmental impact page shows certain key figures to help your customer understand how they will be benefiting the environment by going solar. These calculations are based on EPA studies which can be found here.  This page can also be turned off by account admins if you’d prefer not to show this information.

 
Adjusting Pricing and Financing 
On the Financing Page in Sales Mode, you'll have the option to pick adders and discounts and can select the financing option that your client is interested in.
 

 
The Bill Overview Page
Compare pre- and post-solar bills on the Bill Overview page. Review the impact this system will have on the customer's bottom line. Click on the Preview Bills button to see future cash flows of the project.
 
Send your Proposal
Send the homeowner a link to an interactive Web Proposal, or download the Print Proposal with all of your project details.

 
Using Contract Manager for e-Signature
