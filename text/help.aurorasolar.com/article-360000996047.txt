How do I model a utility that only pays back a percentage of the retail rate for exported electricity?

In some NEM rules, the customer is not credited for excess kWh production at the full retail rate of electricity. Instead, utilities only credit the customer based on a percentage of the retail rate - maybe 5% less, maybe 40% less, depending on the utility. In many cases this is a first-come, first-served tier-based system - the 1st tier will get 100% of retail rate, the 2nd tier will get 95%, and so on until the utility reaches a defined MW capacity of distributed generation on their grid. 
In order to model a percentage reduction, create a financing and select NEM (Utility Rate). Change the Export Rule to Percentage Export Penalty. Enter the reduction into the box on the right - this is the amount that will be removed from the retail rate for compensation. For example, if your utility uses 90% of the retail rate to compensate excess solar production, you should enter a 10% penalty.
