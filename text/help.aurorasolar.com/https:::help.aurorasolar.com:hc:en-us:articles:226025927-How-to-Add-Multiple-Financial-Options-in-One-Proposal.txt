How to Add Multiple Financial Options in One Proposal

         
 Aurora gives you the ability to include up to three different financial options in one proposal. 

Go to the Proposal template page by clicking on your name on the upper right corner of the screen, then clicking on Settings.


Open the template you wish to modify, or create a template by clicking on Create New Template.

Click Textbox then click and drag out a box.

Click the edit button (pencil) at the bottom of a textbox, then click on the down arrow icon to open up the list of placeholders.


Under the financial placeholder section there is a drop down menu with option 1,2, and 3. Change the drop down menu to the appropriate option then select your placeholder. 
Each financial placeholder will have a label: F1, F2, F3 which corresponds to a financial simulation.



Once you have your proposal template setup. Go to a project with a design. Create three financial simulations in the Financing page. Create a proposal using the template on the Proposal page. 
You will notice that the proposal template will ask for multiple financing simulations.
