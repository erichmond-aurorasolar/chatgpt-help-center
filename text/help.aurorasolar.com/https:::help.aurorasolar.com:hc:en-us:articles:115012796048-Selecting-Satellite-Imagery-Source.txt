Selecting Satellite Imagery Source

Aurora is proud to offer multiple sources of satellite imagery to choose from to ensure you have the best imagery available for your design.  Where available, Google HD imagery will load by default. Elsewhere, standard Google imagery will load. We provide access to Bing imagery. Aurora also offers HD imagery through Nearmap for a small fee.  Please note that you can also choose to upload your own custom imagery.
 
Which satellite imagery is right for me?
HD imagery: Aurora offers two sources of HD imagery.  Where available, Google HD imagery is available to all customers at no charge.  We also partner with Nearmap to provide an additional source of HD imagery, available for a small fee.
Standard Google imagery versus Bing: In some locations, standard Google imagery may have a clearer image, while Bing may be clearer for other locations. Bing is also ortho-rectified, meaning that it addresses slanted imagery, although this might come at the expense of higher resolution.
Custom imagery: To design off roof plans for new construction or if you would like to use your own drone footage, Aurora offers the ability to upload your own custom imagery.
 
How do I change satellite imagery sources?
You can select your imagery source in the imagery dropdown in the top design toolbar:
