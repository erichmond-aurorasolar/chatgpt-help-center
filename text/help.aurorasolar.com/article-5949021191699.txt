Adding pages to Sales Mode

Within Aurora settings, admins may access the Sales Mode Customization tab. Here, you can preview the Sales Mode workflow and add four custom page types:

Profile page
Image Gallery page
Video Gallery page
Full Screen image

Once a custom page has been added, admins can reorder, edit, and delete custom pages as needed — up to 10 custom pages.
Custom pages will be adding to your Web Proposal by default, but this may be disabled.
Profile page
Use this to highlight a specific message or value proposition. This consists of a title, message, and byline text & image on one side of the page, and an image or video on the other.
