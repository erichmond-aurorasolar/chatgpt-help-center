Generating Bankable Shade Reports

Once you've created a model and system design for a project, you're ready to generate a bankable Shade Report. To do this, navigate to the Documents section of a project and select "Shade Report." 

 
Please note that our Shade Report feature is only available for Premium users.
 
On the report, you will see project and customer information as well as data relating to the PV system you've designed. Please see below for more information regarding some of the data you will find on your Shade Report. 
 

 


Annual TOF: TOF stands for Tilt and Orientation Factor. The TOF will be represented as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the solar insolation of the actual tilt and orientation by the solar insolation at the optimum tilt and orientation.


Annual Solar Access:Solar Access is defined as the incident solar energy given shading, divided by the incident solar energy if there were no shading:
$$\mathrm{Solar\,Access} = \frac{ E_\mathrm{shade} }{ E_\mathrm{no\,shade} }$$
 


Annual TSRF:
TSRF stands for Total Solar Resource Fraction. The TSRF is the ratio of insolation available accounting for both shading and Tilt and Orientation Factor (TOF), compared to the total insolation available at a given location at the optimum tilt and orientation and with no shading.
