Integrated GPU (such as Intel Iris e.t.c. with 1.5Gb+ memory)

Recommended: Discreet nVidia/AMD GPU  
Less optimal: Integrated GPU (Intel Iris with 2Gb memory e.t.c.) will work, but might be slow, especially if using a high-res monitor (1980x1080 and above).

*2015+ GeForce Quadro GPU series also has great performance and fall under "Recommended / Ideal" section
