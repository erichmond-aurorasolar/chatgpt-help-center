How to Add and Change Rooftop Setbacks

Defining Setbacks
Roof setbacks define how much distance there must be between the system and the edges of the roof. This could due to a jurisdictional requirement, a fire code requirement, or a company design guideline.
You can easily define roof setbacks by clicking on Settings in the top right hand corner of your Site Model. In 2D mode, you are able to specify a setback for each of the following edge types: Eave, Ridge, Valley, Hip, and Rake. Additionally, you can specify setbacks around Obstructions, as well as a general setback that will be applied to all edges that have no edge type specified.
                     
Aurora can also auto-detect edge types for you. To do this, double click outside of the structure you have drawn. This will take the pre-set jurisdiction values the account administrator has entered in the account settings and apply them to the site.
                   Once you have defined your setbacks, Aurora will respect these setbacks in all assisted design steps (e.g. when filling a roof face with modules). Furthermore, the Validation Report will alert you, if any modules violate your setback requirements.
