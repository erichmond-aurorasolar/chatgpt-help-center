Creating a Site Model Using Aurora AI in Sales Mode

Within Sales Mode, the easiest and fastest way to generate a 3D site model is to use Aurora AI. This article will walk you through the steps of creating a new site design using Aurora AI in Sales Mode. 

 
From the Project Dashboard, click on Sales Mode in the top right corner.
Select "+Create new Design".

 
You'll be prompted to toggle certain Sales Mode pages on or off that you may or may not want to show in your Sales Mode Proposal. 
Then click "Create New".

 
The first page in Sales Mode is the Project Overview where you'll want to confirm your customer's contact information.  If you've already filled out this information from the Project Dashboard, it will auto-populate here. 
Then click "Start Proposal" in the top right corner. 

 
On the next page, you'll be able to review your customer's energy usage that was entered from the Project Dashboard and make any adjustments here if necessary. 
Click "Next" to continue on to System Design.
Pro Tip: If you've already entered Energy Usage on the Project Dashboard, you can skip the Energy Usage screen and jump straight to System Design by clicking on the "Project Overview" drop down menu.

 
When the System Design page opens, click "Run now" to have Aurora AI generate your 3D site model and give it a few moments to process your request. 

 
Once the 3D site model has been generated, use the right click button on your mouse to take a look around at the site model in 3D to verify that the AI model is accurate and complete.  If you are on a laptop with no physical mouse, you can click on the 3D navigation ring in the bottom right corner to move around the site model in 3D.

 
Assuming your AI generated site model looks good, you can now move on to place panels.
In the event that Aurora AI isn't able to generate a usable site model, possibly due to lack of HD Imagery or LIDAR data, you can always submit a request for a site model through our Expert Design team.
