Aurora also offers the ability to request a screenshare with our support specialists who can help you with specific questions like financing, proposals, design and configurations.
Need to set up a time to speak with a representative?  
Our support team is happy to help you out! Please send an email to support@aurorasolar.com to set up a screenshare session with our team to answer any questions you have.
 
What about phone support?We are actively working to bring phone support to the Aurora user community, though our chat and email services are effective as well:

We will look-up and reference previous requests you may have submitted previously to solve your problems quickly and efficiently.
Building sales proposals is a visual process- screenshare and email support allows our team to include helpful links and screenshots.

We never outsource our support or employ unqualified staff, so you can rest assured that your email will be answered by a knowledgeable Aurora Solar expert- every time. 
If you've got a question that you need help with, please let us know and our dedicated team will get back to you as soon as possible with a helpful response.
