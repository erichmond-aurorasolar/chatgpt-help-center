Creating Jurisdiction Setbacks in New Aurora - Account Configuration

Roof setbacks define how much distance there must be between the solar system and the edges of the roof. This could be due to a jurisdictional requirement, a fire code requirement, or a company design guideline. You will want to create jurisdiction setbacks in your Aurora Database so that when you create a new project, the relevant jurisdiction setbacks will be applied to your design. 
Please note that only account Administrators can make these changes. 
 
*Note: You will need to provide the setback regulations for the areas where you operate.  This 3rd party site can help get you started by finding the most up to date building and fire codes.
 
Create a New Jurisdiction Setback
Navigate to Database > Jurisdictions and click "Add Jurisdiction". 

 
Name your Jurisdiction Setback
Select whether it is a State or Local Jurisdiction 
Enter the Setback parameters in feet
*Optional: Provide Building or Design Notes relevant to this particular Jurisdiction Setback

In the example above, we created a state of California jurisdiction setback.  Now any new project that is created who's address is in the state of California will have these setback regulations applied automatically. 
If you've created additional specific jurisdiction setback regulations (city, county, municipality) then the most specific setback regulation will be applied. (City of San Francisco will be applied over state of California regulations).
