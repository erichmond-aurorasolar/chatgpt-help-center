Obstructions

You can create a new obstruction in the Design section of a project. Click Add Obstruction in the left toolbar and select the shape you want to model:

Polygon (keyboard shortcut Q)
Rectangle (keyboard shortcut W)
Circle (keyboard shortcut E)

Once you have selected the obstruction shape, you can place the obstruction by clicking and dragging (in the case of rectangular and circular obstructions), or by clicking to place the nodes of a polygonal obstruction (you will have to click on a node to close the shape once you are done defining your polygon).
Note that you can define a setback for obstructions to make sure that no solar panels get placed too close to an obstruction.

Chimneys are typically best represented by rectangular obstructions, skylights and vents by circular obstructions and AC ducts or parapets by polygonal obstructions.
If you have similar obstructions you can click to select the obstruction and click the Detect Similar Obstructions button in the right menu.

After drawing the obstructions you can adjust the dimensions in 3D by clicking the 3D cube and dragging your cursor up or hold right-click and drag.

Click on the obstruction and a menu will appear on the right showing the obstruction specifications. Here you can adjust the setback, obstruction size, or make the obstruction flush to the roof.
