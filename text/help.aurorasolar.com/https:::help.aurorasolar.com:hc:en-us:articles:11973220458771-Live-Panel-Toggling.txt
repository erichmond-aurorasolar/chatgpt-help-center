Live Panel Toggling

Overview
After placing panels in a design in Sales Mode, Aurora will provide an immediate production estimate. With the live panel toggling feature, as you toggle panels on and off to refine the system, that estimate will update live with each panel toggle, speeding up the design process. 

How does live panel toggling work
1. Place Panels
The resulting system should be very close to your target energy offset, and an immediate estimate will appear
2. Toggle panels.
The production estimate should update instantly. 

Note: Estimates are available only when all panels are placed in Sales Mode on the roof. When using ground mounts or any part of the system is placed or changed in Design Mode, the estimates will not update live and users must recalculate to run the full simulation.
3. When totally satisfied with your system, click Finalize.
This will run the full Aurora simulation (if there are microinverters on the panels, otherwise, it will run PVWatts). The offset should not change very much from the initial estimate except in rare cases.
4. If you do want to make further changes, feel free to continue toggling. The estimate will return and update instantly as before
5. When you’re ready to finalize again, click Finalize.
