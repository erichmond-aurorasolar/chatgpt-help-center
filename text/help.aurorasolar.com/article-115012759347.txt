Financial Overview


 
There are two types of financial analysis you can run in Aurora for residential and commercial projects:


Net Metering: A customer is compensated for any extra solar energy produced by the system which offsets their energy consumption.

Feed-in Tariff: A customer is compensated a specific rate for the kWhs the system produces, irrespective of their energy consumption. You only need to know how much power the system will generate and how much the customer gets paid for energy generated.

For a Net Metering financial analysis there are 4 key inputs that you need:

What a customer’s bill looks like before they go solar. You can enter this information in the consumption section.
How much energy their system will produce. You can view this in the simulation section of your design.
How much the system will cost. You can view this in the pricing section.
How the customer will pay for the system. In Aurora this can be cash, loan, lease, or PPA. You create and compare multiple financing options in the financing section of your project.
