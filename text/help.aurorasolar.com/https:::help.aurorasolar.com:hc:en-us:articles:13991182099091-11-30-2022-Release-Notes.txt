API - New Webhook Event: Design Created
A new Design Created webhook triggers when a new design is created for any given project, whether in Aurora, via API, or by an Aurora Expert Design Service designer.


AutoDesigner API: Energy Target Selection in MaxFit Mode
In the past, you could run AutoDesigner API in two modes: place as many panels on the roof as possible (max fit mode) and place only the optimal set of panels that reach the desired production target (energy target mode). AutoDesigner API MaxFit mode can now generate a system that recommends optimal panels that meet an energy target while leaving your sales team the flexibility to toggle panels with the customer.


Qualification Question Customization
New customizations allow Lead Capture AI customers to define their own qualification questions in the Lead Capture AI experience.


List Projects API: Site Address Field
When you call the List Projects API, it will provide you a list of the project IDs, project names, and site addresses from the tenant (up to 100 projects).


Lead Capture AI: Qualification Question Customization
New customizations allow Lead Capture AI customers to define their own qualification questions in the Lead Capture AI experience.


AHJ Identification and Database
Aurora automatically identifies the Authority Having Jurisdiction for US projects and incorporates a new AHJ database that allows users to reference and update requirements for all the jurisdictions their company operates in, ensuring their team is on the same page and allowing them to scale more efficiently.


Lead Capture AI: Utility Bill Capture
From the Lead Capture AI experience, homeowners can directly upload their utility bills for teams to access in the Aurora application.
