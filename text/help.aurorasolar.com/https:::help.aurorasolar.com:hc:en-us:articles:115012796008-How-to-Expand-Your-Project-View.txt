How to Expand Your Project View

There are 2 main ways to expand your project view within Aurora. This article will walk you through both ways in detail.
Expand Satellite Imagery

Go to the Design View of your project


Zoom out of view using either your mouse scroll wheel (or touchpad), or by clicking the +,- arrows in the top left corner of your Design.
As you zoom out and move your mouse outside of the image, a shaded box and diagonal arrows should appear around your site map. Click in the shaded area to expand your site map.


Once you draw your roof, your site map will remain in the extended view.
