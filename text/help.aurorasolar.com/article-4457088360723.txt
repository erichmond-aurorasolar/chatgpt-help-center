Net Cost Values

Overview:
Aurora now shows the system Net Cost to the pricing breakdown on the Financing page, System Summary page, and the Web Proposal. This field can be used as an educational tool to help homeowners understand the cost of their system, as well as incentives applied later on. The total value will be shown in today’s dollars. Note that the net cost will update automatically when the financing product on a project is updated. 

 
Where Can I show Net Cost?
You can use Net Cost in the same area of Sales Mode that displays incentives today. Those product areas are the Financing page, the System Summary page, and the Web Proposal. 
How is Net Cost Calculated? 
Net Cost is calculated as the following:Net Cost = Financed Amount (Total Cost) - Sum of all Year 1+ incentives
What is the Financed Amount? 
When a loan has been applied to the Financing page, the Total Cost field is replaced by a Financed Amount field. The Financed Amount is calculated as the following:
Financed Amount (Total Cost) = (base cost per watt * system size ) + adders + starting cost - year 0 cash grant incentives + dealer fees + storage
