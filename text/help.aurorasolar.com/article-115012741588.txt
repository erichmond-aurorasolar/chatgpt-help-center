4. Create a Financing Option and Generate a Sales Proposal

You can simulate almost any type of financial product in Aurora, including cash deals, loans, PPAs and lease products. We will go through a simple cash deal. Proposals for a project are filled in automatically from a Proposal Template. Aurora will provide you with a number of templates to start off with, and you can always create your own to better suit your clients.
