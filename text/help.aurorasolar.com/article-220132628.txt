Bill of Materials

Bill of Materials can be found under the Documents section of a Design. 
          
Aurora will automatically generate a bill of materials (BOM) for the design you created. You can download this data as a CSV file by clicking Export. 
         
The following component types are included in the BOM:

For each component type, Aurora generates the following data:

Manufacturer: The manufacturer of the component as specified in the database

Item: The name of the component, as specified in the database

Quantity: The quantity of the component in the design
