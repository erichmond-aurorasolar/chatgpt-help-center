Your First Residential Project

Using Aurora, you will be able to turn an address into a full customer-facing proposal in about 15 minutes. In this tutorial, we will walk you through creating a sample project from start to finish. Please exactly follow the steps below to get started.
         
If at anytime you feel stuck, please contact support with your question, and we will schedule a private training session for you.
Creating a new project
On the Map section or on the Project page, click on the Create Project button.
Follow along with our examples by filling out the form with the following information:


Address: 26 Everett Avenue, Staten Island, NY 10309

Name: My First Project

Customer First Name: Joe

Customer Last Name: Solar
 


Good job! You should have just been directed to your first project in Aurora.
Now you are ready to input the customer's electric bill. This will enable Aurora to estimate their load profile (an hourly profile of their energy usage) and accurately model the energy savings from designs you'll be creating.
Entering utility information
Navigate to your project and in the left side bar, click Consumption.
For the Utility Information, select the utility company, rate, and most recent utility rate version relevant to the project. In our case, we will be using:


Utility Provider: Aurora Sample Training Utility

Utility Rate: Aurora Sample Training Rate

Utility Rate Version: 04 Jul 2016 - Present

For Location, select Newark International ARPT.
         
Entering electric bill information
Underneath the monthly graph, ensure "Energy" is selected and input energy (in kWh) for as many months as you can. We will be entering:


Jan: 800 

February: 900

March: 1,200

Aurora will interpolate the rest of the year for you.
If you only know the customer's bill amount, you can input that instead by clicking on Input Bill
