05/27/2021 Release Notes

 
Features Updated

Added validation to 3D Modeling service requests submitted via the API to ensure latitude and longitude coordinates are valid. 
Added fallback logic so that when a performance simulation using submodule simulation is tried but is not possible, the simulation engine will automatically fall back and complete the simulation without this feature being active.
