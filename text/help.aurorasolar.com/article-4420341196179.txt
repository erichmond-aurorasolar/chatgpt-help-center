AutoDesigner Filler Row

Overview: 
Filler row allows you to maximize roof space while running AutoDesigner by allowing the top or bottom row of an array to be the opposite orientation of the rest of your designed panels. For example, you can fill the roof face in portrait orientation, and then if there is any space add a final row in landscape orientation. This is available both in Sales Mode and Design Mode.

How to Use Filler Row:

In Sales Mode:

Open up a design using Aurora’s Design Mode. Click on “Add Solar Panels.” 
Next, click on Advanced Settings. 
Click on “Auto” next to Filler Row to select. 


Tenant Default
If you want “Auto” to be the default selection for Sales Mode, you can set the “Filler Row” field under the “AutoDesigner” section of the “Sales Mode Design” tab on the “Settings” page. Note that a salesperson can still run AutoDesigner without Filler Row if they manually change it before placing panels. This default will not apply in Design Mode.
 
In Aurora’s Design Mode:
AutoDesigner in Filler Row is available both in MaxFit Mode and in Energy Mode.

Open up a design using Aurora’s Design Mode. Next, click on Autodesigner.
Select Energy or Max Fit mode.
You’ll now see a new gray menu on the right-hand side of the screen. Click on Advanced settings. 
Click on “Auto” next to Filler Row to select.


That’s it! AutoDesigner will now place arrays with filler rows if it maximizes the number of panels in your design or as needed to meet the desired energy output. As a reminder, you’ll need to complete the steps above for any new design in Aurora.
