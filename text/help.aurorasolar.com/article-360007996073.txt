Submitting a Request to our 3D Modeling Service

Aurora’s 3D Modeling Service provides users with an opportunity to request a 3D model within the app. We have teamed up with a group of professionals to provide you with fast, accurate models of your work sites!* Each model includes Nearmap HD imagery. 
*3D model service is currently only available 7:00AM PST to 7:00PM PST (Monday - Saturday). Models requested outside of these hours may be completed the next business day.
To request a model, follow these steps:
Step 1: Create New Project and enter your desired address
Go to Projects → Create New Project → Create

Step 2: Click on Design and choose Make a Request
In the menu on the left, create a design by clicking ‘+’ next to Designs→ Having Trouble Modeling Roofs? → Make a Request

Step 3: Move Green House Icon over requested property
Drag green icon over property → Request

Once requested, the window will display the time when your model will be available.
Step 4: Relax while you wait for your 3D model! 
Your model should be returned within 3 hours. You can check the progress of your request by looking at the time wheel next to the Model Request either within the project or on the Projects tab.

Once the model is finished, you will receive an email from Aurora Solar informing you of the completion of your request with a link to review the design. If you are pleased with the design, click ‘Use This Model’ to design your system!
If you are unhappy with the model, you can choose to have the model adjusted by our team or cancel your request and we'll refund your credit:
