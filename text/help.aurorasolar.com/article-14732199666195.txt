How to Define Weather Datasets Default Settings in New Aurora

Overview
Weather Dataset Default Setting allows Tenant Admins to specify the desired default weather dataset to be used for Aurora simulations in New Aurora. The default data set used for Aurora simulations has also been updated from TMY3 to NREL-PSM, a dataset with more recent and granular data.
Note: The weather dataset will now be set to NREL-PSM by default until a tenant admin updates it. This only applies to new designs; any old designs will continue to use the previously selected weather dataset. This applies to New Aurora ONLY, this setting cannot be changed in Legacy Aurora. 
How to Set Default weather datasets
1. In New Aurora, Tenant Admins will access the Tenant Settings. Within the Performance simulations menu, the Admin will select the weather dataset they wish to set as default. 

Ensure to change the setting in the Aurora Simulation section. 
2. After creating a design, the user can access the Simulation preferences menu within design Mode and override the default dataset defined by the Admin.
