How Projects Are Classified

Classification of New Projects
With the release of Aurora’s commercial financing features, you must now indicate project type (residential or commercial) when creating a project. 
Select either the residential or commercial button when creating a project:

You will now see the project type in the project description at the top of the screen:

It should be noted that a project’s classification cannot be changed once the project has been created (i.e., you cannot change a residential project to a commercial project or vice versa). Please make sure that your project is correctly classified before starting as some features are specific to project type.

Classification of Past Projects
In order to make commercial financial analysis available to relevant existing projects, as part of the launch of this feature, Aurora has classified existing projects as either “commercial” or “residential.” 
The following criteria were used to reclassify projects in our system:


Systems larger than 25kW have been classified as commercial, with the following exceptions:



Projects with existing load profiles and/or financial analysis have not been reclassified as commercial, as those load profiles and financial analyses are incompatible with new commercial load profiles and financial analysis.

The projects with existing load profiles and/or financial analysis will remain classified as residential.


Systems smaller than 25kW are classified as residential (no change). 

If you are encountering difficulties due to the retroactive classification, please email support@aurorasolar.com
