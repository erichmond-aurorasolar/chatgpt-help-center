Ruler Tool




Overview:The ruler tool allows you to gather measurements of any portion of your building or site design. This tool can be especially helpful when designing from new construction or imported imagery.
To use this tool click the ruler icon in the lower-left portion of the design page. 

 
Now you can click on the start of your measurement, and click again to close the ruler and see the measurement. 

Once the ruler has been placed you can edit the length of an area and switch between 2D (laying on the ground) and 3D (conforming to the roof surface) views by clicking on the measurement itself. This will pull up the Ruler Segment settings window in the top right-hand corner of the page. 

 
 
How to Use the Ruler Tool:
1.) Select the ruler icon in the bottom left corner of your page. You can also draw by clicking once to place the start of your measurement and once again to place the end of your measurement.
2.) Click once and hold down your mouse, dragging to extend the ruler.
3.) Next hold down your mouse and drag to extend the ruler. 
4.) Unclick your mouse at the end of the area that you would like to measure. 
5.) You will know when you have measured your area successfully when you see a yellow line across the area you have measured. You will also see the measurement in the metric unit (designated under Settings) above the yellow line.
