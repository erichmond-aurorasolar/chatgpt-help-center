Massachusetts SMART Program: What is it and how to model it in Aurora

Overview:The Massachusetts SMART Program offers a production-based incentive at a set rate for a set number of years, but the specific value for behind-the-meter installations varies based on the location of the customer and the utility they receive service from. Users can model the SMART program as a Production-Based Incentive (PBI) in Aurora, but will have to find the value from the SMART spreadsheet. The spreadsheet will show the Solar Incentive Payment ($/kWh) and the Duration (years) which can be input in Aurora’s incentive modeling section.
