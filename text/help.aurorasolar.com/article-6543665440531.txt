Features Updated

Sales Mode Navigation Updates - To simplify the navigation menu in Sales Mode, we've eliminated the sidebar and now bring you directly to the page when selecting each tile. This provides a more intuitive, easy-to-use experience for the sales rep.
HTTP Responses by Endpoint - We updated our API Reference to show a full list of HTTP responses you might receive for each endpoint. With the list of responses, you can build better quality integrations with Aurora by proactively handling error responses in your code.
Removed CAD Preview Page in Sales Mode - When entering the System Design page in Sales Mode, users will be brought directly into CAD, simplifying the Sales Mode workflow and reducing unnecessary clicks.Â
