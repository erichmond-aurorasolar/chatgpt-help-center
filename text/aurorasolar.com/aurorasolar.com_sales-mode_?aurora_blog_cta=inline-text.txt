            Aurora has given us the ability to design efficiently and be confident that we’re providing to the customer a detailed representation of what is going to be on-site without traveling there.

                    VP of Sales, Baker Electric                



            It's such a game-changer that we don’t have to take Suneye readings anymore which saves us time and money. It's wonderful to utilize a platform like Aurora to be so confident in what the system will produce.

                    VP of Sales/Co-founder Lumina Solar                



            The value add to the sales process was huge because we can actually walk through the design with the homeowner. The customer feels like we’re redesigning and building it with them which lends more credibility to us as a company and makes it seem like we’re not just salespeople.

            Previous software was a very manual process, so sales reps could spend 2 hours in the home. Now they can get all of that done in about 20 mins.
