                        The Lifelong Learner                    



                The Lifelong Learner            

TMI doesn’t exist for the Lifelong Learner. They love getting immersed in a subject and when they take on a project they take it on full force.



 




Here’s how to modify your sales pitch for the Lifelong Learner:
Focus on

Showing them the site model along with LIDAR, Irradiance, and Sun-Path Modeling
Energy consumption projections
Financial projections and payback estimates

Focus less on

Bill savings
Aesthetics
Environmental benefits










                Using Sales Mode with the Lifelong Learner            

To build trust with the Lifelong Learner you’ll want to share how solar can create resilience in the event something does go wrong. You should aim to educate them using the Energy Usage Page, Energy Offset Chart, and Battery Storage Page in Sales Mode.

                        The Cost Saver                    



                The Cost Saver            

A penny saved is a penny earned for the Cost Saver. Contrary to popular belief, Cost Savers don’t mind spending money, they just want to make sure they’re getting the best value.



 




Here’s how to modify your sales pitch for the Cost Saver:
Focus on

Their current energy bill & consumption estimates
Financial projections and payback estimates
Pre- and post-solar bill estimates
National and local incentives
Company discounts and promotions

Focus less on

Aesthetics
Environmental benefits
Energy production (Irradiance, LIDAR, sun path modeling, etc.)










                Using Sales Mode with the Cost Saver            

To build trust with the Cost Saver you’ll want to share how going solar can actually help them achieve their cost saving goals. You should aim to educate them using the Bill Overview Page, Monthly Average Bill Chart, Adders/ Discounts Page, and Financing Page in Sales Mode.

                The Cool Kid on the Block            

Beauty isn’t skin deep, it’s solar deep. The Cool Kid on the Block cares just as much about how a solar panel looks as what it does.



 




Here’s how to modify your sales pitch for the Cool Kid on the Block:
Focus on

Showing them the 3D model of their home (including street view)
Higher end solar panels that have a modern feel
How you can move the solar panels to their desired location
Environmental benefits that they can brag about to their neighbors

Focus less on

Financial projections and payback estimates
Bill savings
Max-fit designs and NEM policies










                Using Sales Mode with the Cool Kid on the Block            

To build trust with the Cool Kid on the Block you’ll want to position solar as the “modern” way to produce energy and showcase your best looking solar panels. You should aim to educate them using the Performance Simulation Page and the Sun-Path Animation in Sales Mode.

                The Green Crusader            

Reduce, reuse, recycle. The Green Crusader wants to be environmentally responsible and doesn’t mind spending money to live a more sustainable lifestyle.



 




Here’s how to modify your sales pitch for the Green Crusader:
Focus on

Energy consumption offset
Energy production (Irradiance, sunpath modeling, etc.)
Environmental impact of switching to solar
Other upgrades, such as battery storage and EV charging

Focus less on

Payback periods and financial modeling
Aesthetics

                The Independence Seeker            

Better safe than sorry. The Independence Seeker doesn’t necessarily think our infrastructure will fail, but they’d like to be prepared in case it does.

Focus on

Energy production (Irradiance, sunpath modeling, energy offset, etc.)
Net energy metering and over-production
Other upgrades such as battery storage and EV charging
