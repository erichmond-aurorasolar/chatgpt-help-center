At the heart of any solar sale is a great proposal. A compelling, personalized proposal that speaks directly to your customer’s needs gives you a real leg up on the competition. Likewise, a generic, text-heavy proposal that reads like a legal contract can put your sales team at a disadvantage.
But, what makes a great proposal? We had a roundtable discussion with a group of solar experts to answer that very question. Based on their advice, we developed the Solar Sales Playbook For Proposals That Close. Click below to download the full playbook.

In this blog, we’ll look at some of the highlights from the playbook to get you started.
Customize your proposal
Before you do anything, you need to know what type of buyer you’re dealing with. Someone who’s looking for relief from a huge electric bill will want to see different things in their proposal than a homeowner who’s looking to help cut their environmental impact. 
Our research on the 5 Types of Solar Buyers is a great place to get a detailed look at the different categories of buyers that you’ll likely encounter. But, it’s tough to know exactly what any particular customer is looking for before you meet them and ask them some questions. Once you know the unique challenges they face, and goals they have, you’re in a better spot to deliver a proposal that meets their specific needs.
The roundtable of solar sales experts says…
Being able to deliver a customized, frictionless proposal process is as important to your prospective customer as it is for your sales reps. Equipping your sales team with smart software will empower them to:

Make adjustments on the spot based on customer feedback
Show the customer the cost adders, incentives, and discounts that are automatically built into the system
Close with automated contract generation and integrated e-signature options

Making adjustments in real-time is key to a proposal that closes.
Highlight the finances
While every buyer is different, one thing most people are concerned about is system cost. With so many incentives, tax breaks, and other considerations, though, financing is also one of the things customers find most confusing.
Solar customers appreciate when a proposal includes information that helps them make sense of their options. You can help remove financial barriers for prospective customers by showing them federal and local incentives, as well as attractive loan options tailored to their needs. 
The roundtable of solar sales experts says…
Use your proposal to position yourself as an informative teacher rather than a salesperson. By empathizing with your leads and working with them on their concerns, you will win their trust and leave a positive impression.
This means you’ll need to be able to answer a few questions accurately, and honestly:

How much will the system cost, all in?
How much will the customer save over time?
What are the details on the incentive types and loan options the customer may qualify for?

There’s no denying it: savings rules.
Be exceptional 
We know, you are exceptional! Don’t be afraid to show it, and make sure you have software that lets you present your company’s differentiators in a compelling way.
The roundtable of solar sales experts says…
Your company’s value should be clearly spelled out in all of your solar sales proposals so that your prospective customer doesn’t have to read between the lines. Be sure to highlight:

Unique customer testimonials
Warranties and other concrete benefits your company offers
Experience, certifications, and other expertise your team brings to the table

In closing…
In the end, a great sales proposal that hits on all the questions and concerns each of your customers has helps you close more deals. Period.
