As the solar industry grows, installers face an ever-changing and extremely competitive environment, not to mention a complex web of regulations and incentives. To thrive in this challenging, but fulfilling industry, you have to be able to solve potential problems and respond to customer requests quickly, efficiently, and accurately.
Using all the features of your solar design and sales software is a key part of this equation. You’re paying for it anyway, right? You may as well get the absolute most you can out of it. Of course, it can be difficult to know everything software like Aurora’s can do, and in the heat of the moment it can be tempting to just do things manually. 
In this series, we’re counting down the top 10 things installers don’t know Aurora can do. In each installment we highlight a feature that can save you significant time and money, can make your proposals more compelling, or a combination of all three. We investigate the issues they can help solve, and include instructions — complete with step-by-step screenshots and GIFs — and links so you can take action immediately.
We’ll be revealing a new feature each week as we count down from #10 (Code and Setback Requirements) to #1 (?), so check back often!
