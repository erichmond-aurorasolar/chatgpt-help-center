Design Mode
Maximize accuracy and speed










Create designs without the truck roll
Create highly accurate solar designs without having to visit the site, saving time and money during the quoting process.







Speed up design without sacrificing accuracy
Aurora’s remote site assessment, LIDAR-based shade analysis, and AI-assisted 3D modeling give you pixel-perfect design almost instantly.







Streamline your entire design workflow
Create, edit, and simulate your system design all from the same place with our in-app CAD engine.

















LIDAR-based shade analysis
Forget about on-site shade measurements, Aurora’s irradiance engine provides shade analysis values that are statistically equivalent.














Automatic system design
Automatically fill roof surfaces with pre-strung modules, inverters, and BOS components. 














NEC validation reports
Review your electrical configuration through Aurora’s validation reports and check your system for NEC compliance.








                    The future of solar starts now

                    George Young                


                    Director of Solar Development, Solar Energy Services                



            We’ve had 4 cases where customers didn’t agree with the measurements on the Aurora design that we presented virtually. We decided to go out to the site and measure the house by hand with the homeowner, and in every instance, Aurora was correct. They were actually wrong about the measurements of their own home. The accuracy of the Aurora software, combined with our willingness to put it to the test on-site, helped close the deal each time!

                    VP of Design & Engineering at Infinity Energy                



            It's all about customer expectations. It's a great experience for everyone: the rep, the company, the customer. It makes the whole process easier when you get it right from the start        









                    Dean Scott                


                    Director of Operations, Sunpro                



            We can now create a design for a home in a predetermined amount of time. When it becomes more of a push-of-a-button as opposed to an order, it definitely helps our efficiency. When that pipeline of jobs becomes exponentially bigger, it becomes more and more critical.

            The final product that we’re presenting to the homeowner is just so much more professional. The 3D models, sunpath, LIDAR, and other tools are very effective in a sale.
